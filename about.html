    <p>We came up with an idea of building ‘Vesper’ brand while sitting on a beach during a sunset. We wanted to be on the water instead on the sand. The name ‘Vesper’ is obvious. It means sunset in latin. The hard part was developing great technology and making it even better.</p>

    <h3>Do you know how your board is made?</h3>

    <p>We have a design and construction background, so searching for the answer to this question is pure fun. To answer this question we decided to build epoxy Stand Up Paddle Board. It is a perfect board to enjoy sunset on a lake.
    After that came surfboards. Thanks to the epoxy used, they were much lighter and stronger from typical surfboard on the market.
    On the way we have meet lots of influential and inspiring people. We teamed up with a partner with huge experience in wood manufacture and decided to build first kitesurf board.
    In the future we will continue to do what we are best at. We will search for new technologies, develop new ideas and build better boards.
    If you have ever wondered how your board is made, make a visit to us at HQ.</p>
